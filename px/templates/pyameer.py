"""
Assuming there already exists some [pixi] project (preferably from a git repo already initialized), here's what'll happen:
    1. add my ruff config
    2. add pipelight (HCL) preloaded with ruff formatting + linting and initialize it from within the project

Therefore the flow would be:
    1. Initialize a Git repo
    2. Initialize Pixi project in there
    3. `px init`
    4. Change ruff `target-version` in ruff.toml
